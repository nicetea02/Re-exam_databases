First searching on which chromosome and what position the MALAT1 in mus musculus is located: http://www.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus/Gene/Summary?db=core;g=ENSMUSG00000092341;r=19:5795690-5802672

We notice that the sequence for the MALAT1 gene starts at 5795690 bp, add 100 to this number and use it in our query.

Next we write our curl request through the URL by : https://rest.ensembl.org/sequence/region/mouse/19:5795690..5795790?content-type=fasta

With the outcome of fastaformat:
